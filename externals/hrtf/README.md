Build
-----

Make sure you have a copy of Pure Data installed to your system.

Compile with:

    make

To build for multiple architectures on macOS, set the `arch` and `extension` Makefile variables. For example, to build for 64 bit Intel and Apple Silicon:

    make arch="x86_64 arm64" extension=d_fat

Usage
-----

To load this external in Pd, include the directory containing the following files in your Pd search paths:

* zirkhrtf~.pd_* or zirkhrtf~.d_fat: compiled external
* zirkhrtf~-help.pd: help file
* zirkhrtf_data.txt: KEMAR data set
